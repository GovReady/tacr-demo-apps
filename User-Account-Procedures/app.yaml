    The TACR System has implemented user account procedures to disable inactive user accounts after 90-days of inactivity. The TACR support staff monitors all user accounts to ensure this procedure is enforced. Section 6.3, Authentication Management, of the TACR SSP illustrates the exact procedures the TACR support staff follows to ensure accounts are properly managed.

    The TACR System system does not have guest or anonymous accounts.
