    Access privileges are used to ensure that only authorized personnel access certain areas of the TACR System system. User access is controlled by the completion and submission of TACR System System Rules of Behavior and New User Account Request forms by the user and management.

    These items are completed and submitted whenever a new user requires access or an existing user requires access changes. The system administrator, based on need-to-know, assigns the proper permissions. The employeeâ€™s manager approves the access rights before the initial account is created by signing off on the forms. Finally, the system administrator implements the access rights according to the New User Account Request form. The security staff and the support contractor to determine recertification requirements review accounts periodically. Accounts no longer in use are removed from the system by the system administrator.
