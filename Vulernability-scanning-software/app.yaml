    Vulernability scanning software is software that systematically examines a system
    for known weaknesses and incorrect configuration.

    This application will make sure you are properly using Vulernability scanning
    software to protect CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information) as per NIST 800-53r4
    controls.

    {{organization}} uses Vulernability scanning software to the organization:

    a. Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications
    [Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with
    organization-defined process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting
    the system/applications are identified and reported;

    b. Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability
    among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using
    standards for:

    b.1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;

    b.2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and

    b.3. Measuring vulnerability impact;

    c. Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;

    d. Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response
    times] in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and

    e. Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security
    control assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
    to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e.,
    systemic weaknesses or deficiencies). Vulernability scanning software is software
    that systematically examines a system for known weaknesses and incorrect configuration.
