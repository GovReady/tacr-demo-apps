    {{organization}} uses TACR System Security Plan to the organization:

    a. Develops a security plan for the information system that:

    a.1. Is consistent with the organizationï¿½s enterprise architecture;

    a.2. Explicitly defines the authorization boundary for the system;

    a.3. Describes the operational context of the information system in terms of missions
    and business processes;

    a.4. Provides the security categorization of the information system including
    supporting rationale;

    a.5. Describes the operational environment for the information system and relationships
    with or connections to other information systems;

    a.6. Provides an overview of the security requirements for the system;

    a.7. Identifies any relevant overlays, if applicable;

    a.8. Describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements
    including a rationale for the tailoring decisions; and

    a.9. Is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated representative
    prior to plan implementation;

    b. Distributes copies of the security plan and communicates subsequent changes
    to the plan to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];

    c. Reviews the security plan for the information system [Assignment: organization-defined
    frequency];

    d. Updates the plan to address changes to the information system/environment of
    operation or problems identified during plan implementation or security control
    assessments; and
