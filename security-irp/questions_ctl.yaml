    Your Incident Response Plan, or IRP, describes how your organization responds when things go wrong.

    Knowing what your organization will do when things go wrong is considered an important control to keep individual incidents from turning into major disasters. It's knowing how your team puts out small and medium size fires in order to prevent the entire house (or neighborhood) from burning to the ground.

    But you will only know if your plan to keep small fires from becoming big fires works if you practices it.

    When it comes to IRPs, auditors want to know that 1) you have a written plan, 2) your organization regularly practices and updates the plan, and 3) the plan includes how you meet reporting obligations required by customer contracts or government regulation.

    Auditors consider the following to be "incidents": unauthorized access or getting hacked, loss or corruption of data (intentional or accidental), interruption in a service considered critical to your business or the business of your customers. Any of these events effect the value of your business if not responded to quickly and properly.

    So for the control narrative, we will need to make sure:

      1. You have a written Incident Response Plan
      2. Your IRP can be easily accessed and used by your teams during an incident
      3. Employees and staff practice and update the plan regularly

    Get your organization's IRP now if it exists. If you don't have an IRP, we'll help you create one.
